 # STL
 - Stands for Standard Template Library.
 - Is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc.
 - Has four components (Containers , Algorithms , Iterators , Functions).

 (1) Algorithms <br>
    - The header algorithm defines a collection of functions specially designed to be used on a range of elements.<br>
    - Examples of these functions : <br>
      -> sort ()<br>
      -> min ()<br>
      -> max ()<br>
      -> swap ()<br>
      
   (2) Containers <br>
    - Containers or container classes store objects and data.<br>
    - Has five types (Simple , Sequence , Associative , Unordered , Adapter).<br>
    <pre>
      Simple -> pair <br>
    </pre>
