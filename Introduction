 # STL
 - Stands for Standard Template Library.
 - Is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc.
 - Has four components (Containers , Algorithms , Iterators , Functions).

 (1) Algorithms <br>
 - The header algorithm defines a collection of functions specially designed to be used on a range of elements.<br>
 - Examples of these functions : <br>
      --> sort ()<br>
      --> min ()<br>
      --> max ()<br>
      --> swap ()<br>
      
  (2) Containers <br>
  - Containers or container classes store objects and data.<br>
  - Has five types (Simple , Sequence , Associative , Unordered , Adapter).<br>
      --> Simple :- (pair) <br>
      --> Sequence :- (array , vector , deque , list , forward list)<br>
      --> Associative :- (set , multiset , map , multimap)<br>
      --> Unordered :- (unordered set , unordered multiset , unordered map , unordered multimap)<br>
      --> Adapter :- (stack , queue , priority queue)<br>
      
  (3) Iterators
  - Are used to point at the memory addresses of STL containers. <br>
  begin() :- used to return the beginning position of the container.<br>
  end() :- used to return the after end position of the container.<br>
